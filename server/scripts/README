1. Prepare the scripts

   - Update testdb_info.js with wikis you want to download from
	  and also set the # titles and fractions for randomly picked
	  titles and recently edited pages.
   - If you have ns0 title dumps locally and don't need to download them,
	  update gen_titles.js and toggle forceDumpsRefresh

2. Fetch top ranked titles by running fetch_top_ranked.js

3. Fetch recently edited titles by running fetch_rc.js

4. Run gen_titles.js to:
	* downloads dumps
   * generate random selection of titles
   * merge the two sets (random selection, recently edited) of
     titles and generate a single unique title list.
   * generate sql import scripts

5. Upload/move the sql files to the right server/directory.

6. On your target server, use mysqladmin/mysql or whatever to
   generate your new db.

7. If necessary, init the db with the schema found in ../sql/create_everything.mysql

8. Run the mysql import scripts to populate your rt-testing db.

You are all done generating the new db.

Update your rt-testing server settings to point to the new db
and restart the server.
