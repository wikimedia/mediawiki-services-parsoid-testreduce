1. Prepare the scripts
   Update download.sh, testdb_info.sh, importAll.sh
   with wikis you want to download from and also set
   the # titles and fractions for randomly picked titles
   and recently edited pages.
 
2. Download latest title dumps by running download.sh

3. Fetch recently edited titles by running fetch_rc.js

4. Run gen_titles.js to:
   * generate random selection of titles 
   * merge the two sets (random selection, recently edited) of
     titles and generate a single unique title list.
   * generate sql import scripts

5. Upload/move the sql files to the right server/directory.

6. On your target server, use mysqladmin/mysql or whatever to
   generate your new db.

7. Init the db with the schema found in ../sql/create_everything.mysql

8. Run the mysql import scripts to populate your rt-testing db.

You are all done generating the new db.

Update your rt-testing server settings to point to the new db
and restart the server.
