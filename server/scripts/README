1. Stop the services (parsoid-vs-core-vd & parsoid-vs-core-vd-client).

2. Update testdb.info.js with wikis you want to download from.

   Helpful utility: Use "bash get_wp_list.sh <start> <count>" to extract
   <count> titles from wps.json starting at offset <start>.
   Ex: "bash get_wp_list.sh -150 50" will get 50 titles starting
   at index -150 (150 from the end). This script excludes wikis
   wiki language variants enabled.

   Copy this list to testdb.info.js

3. Run init_db.sh $DBPASSWD script (the password can be found in
   /etc/testreduce/parsoid-vs-core-vd.settings.js)

4. Update the client config file for testreduce (in /etc/testreduce),
   if necessary (for example, to change the "gitCommitFetch" section
   if a new train has rolled out.) The configuration is not puppetized
   and can be edited directly.

5. Restart services (parsoid-vs-core-vd & parsoid-vs-core-vd-client).

6. Check that tests are running (sudo journalctl -u parsoid-vs-core-vd)
