1. Stop the services (parsoid-vs-core-vd & parsoid-vs-core-vd-client).
2. Update testdb.info.js with wikis you want to download from.
3. Run init_db.sh $DBPASSWD script (the password can be found in
   /etc/testreduce/parsoid-vs-core-vd.settings.js)
4. Update the client config file for testreduce (in /etc/testreduce),
   if necessary (for example, to change the "gitCommitFetch" section
   if a new train has rolled out.) The configuration is not puppetized
   and can be edited directly.
5. Restart services (parsoid-vs-core-vd & parsoid-vs-core-vd-client).
6. Check that tests are running (sudo journalctl -u parsoid-vs-core-vd)
